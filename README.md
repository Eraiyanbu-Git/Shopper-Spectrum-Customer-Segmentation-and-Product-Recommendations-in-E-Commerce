## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Shopper Spectrum** is an end-to-end machine learning solution for the e-commerce domain. It segments customers based on their purchase behavior using **RFM analysis and KMeans clustering**, and recommends similar products using **item-based collaborative filtering** powered by **cosine similarity**. It is deployed through an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms generate huge amounts of transactional data daily. Leveraging this data can unlock:
- **Customer segmentation** for targeted marketing
- **Product recommendations** to boost user engagement
- **Retention strategies** for at-risk customers
- **Inventory optimization** based on purchasing patterns

This project aims to deliver insights through **unsupervised learning** and **collaborative filtering**.
